## Service
Start data pipeline service using following command in this repo - 
> make run

It will start local server and bind it to localhost:8080

Some seed data is added to postgresDB which got synced to elasticsearch as well. You can apply CRUD operations on fold-finance DB tables from postgres shell and it would sync with elasticsearch as well.
All documents from elasticsearch could be fetched from API Endpoints.

# API Testing
Import `fold_data_pipeline.postman_collection.json` file in postman. It contains collection of all query Endpoints for elasticsearch.

# TroubleShooting
### psql command not found
If psql is not identified by the terminal, export postgres path in `.bashrc` file. Add following line in `.bashrc` file - 
> export PATH=/path/to/postgres/bin:$PATH
